# Credit Card Application Fraud Detection using Self Organising Maps(SOMs) 

## Business Problem
#### The purpose of this project was to design an unsupervised model that can detect frauds in the credit card application system.

## Model
#### Self-organising maps were used to solve this problem.
#### After basic EDA, the dataset was scaled and provided as input to the model.
####A 10x10 grid was created. An input length of 15 was provided, and 100 iterations were performed.
#### A visual was created to see the defaulters.

## Improved Model
#### After the visual was plotted and the fraudsters were known, an ANN was built using this data as input to see the probability of the predicted fraudsters being actual fraudsters.
